The Red Season: A Festive Reflection on Menstrual Life


They call it the season of red; red ribbons on gifts, red dresses in Christmas photos, red lights blinking from street corners.
But somewhere, in quieter rooms and hidden moments, another red season unfolds. One that doesn’t come with carols or confetti, the season of womanhood.
Menstrual life.
A rhythm as ancient as creation itself, yet still spoken of in whispers.


When the World Wears Red
December has always fascinated me; it is a month where the world seems to bloom again in joy, generosity, and color. Everywhere you turn, there’s a celebration of life.
And maybe that’s what menstruation is, too: a biological celebration of life’s potential.

But while some hang ornaments, others hide sanitary pads in purses, praying no one notices the discomfort beneath the smiles.
And that’s where the contrast hurts:
One red is celebrated.
The other is silenced.

At Beulah Walk of Hope, we’ve met young girls who see their periods not as natural rhythms but as monthly battles of shame, of affordability, of misinformation.
And we’ve met women who soldier through cramps while still cooking, serving, laughing, and leading through the Christmas rush.



The Unseen Christmas Story
Maybe if we look closely, the story of Christmas itself; of birth, of womanhood, of sacrifice, is deeply intertwined with menstruation.
Because before Mary held the baby in a manger, she had a body that bled like every woman’s.
Before the miracle, there was a woman’s biology quietly doing its work in divine cycles.

Menstruation is not a curse; it is the calendar of creation, the rhythm that shows that life is possible. So when we speak of joy to the world, perhaps we should also sing respect to the women whose bodies carry that miracle every month.


Periods and Presents
This festive season, as we wrap gifts for loved ones, we are also wrapping care packs, sanitary pads, wipes, pain relief, for girls who can’t afford the comfort many take for granted.
Because Christmas should not just be about the gifts under the tree, but the dignity we extend to others. And no girl should have to choose between food and sanitary protection.


A Red Reminder
As women, we carry so many calendars within us.
The calendar of work.
The calendar of love.
The calendar of cycles.
And through it all, we keep showing up, hosting, nurturing, creating magic even when our bodies are crying for rest. So this season, may we give ourselves permission to pause.
To sip water.
To listen to our bodies.
To remember that the same red that colors the streets this December flows through us as a symbol of resilience and renewal.


The Real Festivity
The real celebration is not in fireworks or feasts, it’s in the strength of women who keep giving life, in every sense of the word.
So here’s to the girls and women who smile (or don’t smile) through cramps, host Christmas parties while in pain, and still show up with grace.
You are the rhythm that keeps the world turning.

This Christmas, join Beulah Walk of Hope in spreading period positivity and dignity.
Sponsor a menstrual care kit. Start a conversation. Remind a girl that her body is not a burden but a blessing.
Let us make this festive season one of comfort, compassion, and crimson courage.
